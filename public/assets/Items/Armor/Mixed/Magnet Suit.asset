  text: "A patched-up, darned, but reliable suit. It\u2019s saved its owner\u2019s
    hide more than once. The owner repaid it in full, by outfitting it with drives,
    replacing the dying breathing circuit with a new, compact one, which required
    sacrificing one of the batteries. Stalkers say that this suit literally draws
    artifacts to it, which is where it gets its name. Others say that all it attracts
    is mutants. The owner of this suit went missing during one of his trips. Curious
    fact: only the owner went missing\u2014the suit was found in the same condition
    it was in before the trip. Rumor has it that the Zone was terribly fond of the
    owner of the Magnet, and it took him for itself. But rumors have a way of staying
    rumors, right?"
