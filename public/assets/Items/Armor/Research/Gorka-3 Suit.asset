    text: 'This suit consists of a coat and pants with suspenders. For a better fit and to prevent it from flapping around like a sail in the wind, it has a system of zip ties made of braids of rubber fabric along the sides of the coat, on the sleeves, under the knees, and at the bottom of the pants. A light, concealed body armor can be worn under the coat.'
