  text: Heavy combat engineer armor developed by a Korean company as part of a joint
    order by several private military companies. It reached the Zone via the black
    market. It does not provide good anomalous protection, but is excellent for lengthy
    combat. The bulky helmet of this armor was seen as unusable in Zone conditions
    and swapped for a more suitable version.
