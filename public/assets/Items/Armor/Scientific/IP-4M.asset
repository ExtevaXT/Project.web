  text: "This gas mask with an IP-4M closed breathing system is a really handy gizmo.
    The most comfortable way to wear it is with a hazmat suit. Someone decided to
    multiply the benefit of wearing this suit a tenfold by creating a lining made
    of light plates that improve protection against bullets and other forms of physical
    damage. What they ended up with was a good suit for a novice stalker who has
    grown out of wearing a jacket, but can\u2019t yet afford a suit like the Zarya
    model."
