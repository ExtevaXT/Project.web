  text: "A \u201Cblank\u201D for a future artifact, the Proto-Jellyfish absorbs radioactive
    particles from the surrounding area and uses them as \u201Cfuel\u201D for its
    own development. Maturing inside an anomaly, it eventually becomes a fully-fledged
    artifact, most often a Jellyfish. If this artifact is extracted from an anomaly
    in time, its development stops. It will never become a true Jellyfish, but it
    retains its ability to absorb and contain radiation. However, the side effect
    of wearing this artifact is a slight feeling of fatigue."
