    text: 'The gas produced by the artifact both makes the owner’s tissues coarser and stimulates their organ systems after injury. However, when under the effects of the artifact, movement requires more effort. Some believe that the artifact is a Shell that fell into a Vortex and eventually lost all its electric charge.'
