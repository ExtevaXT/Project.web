  text: "These experimental developments can currently only be found on the black
    market, as official production of them has been deemed illegal. The principle
    according to which these batteries function is based on the use of the Zone\u2019s
    anomalous energy. Representatives of the scientific community assure us that
    anomalous batteries are not safe to use."
